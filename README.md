This is a random project that I have created between the 1st and 4th of January, inspired by another FiveM server manager that was commercial and closed sourced (and ended up being taken down on 5mods, twice).

NOTE: This is not ready for production! I'm not responsable for random crashes and unstability.

## Install

1. Download the program from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/justalemon/ServerManager/releases) (select ServerManager.7z)
1. Extract the contents of the file with 7zip or WinRar somewhere on your PC
1. Open ServerManager.exe

## Usage

1. If you don't have a FiveM License
    1. On the top bar, click "Generate FiveM License" to get a Server License from the FiveM page (they are free, just follow the instructions)
    1. Once you have your license (a 32 digit alphanumeric string like `8X8Kcn7eYnzVNk9d6agRCFnH4Rw3fN35`) go back to ServerManager
    1. Click Options, paste your License on the text field and click Save
1. Select a server build on the left list
1. If you don't have a Server Data folder
    1. Click "Create Server Sata" on the top
